# Sentiment Analysis of US Airlines in 2015 using NLP on Twitter data

As part of my projects in MIE1624: Intro to Data Science and Analytics, I had to conduct a sentiment analysis of US Airlines in 2015 based on tweets to answer the following question, "What can public opinion on Twitter tell us about the US airlines in 2015?" In essence, the goal is to essentially use sentiment analysis on Twitter data to get insight into the people's opinions on US airlines. 

In this project, Twitter data was already provided. The work that needed to be completed is a report in the form of a Jupyter notebook detailing the analysis and answer to the question. My process of data cleaning, exploratory analysis, model preparation, model implementation and discussion of results are shown on the Jupyter Notebook.
